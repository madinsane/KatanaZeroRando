# KatanaZeroRando
This is a randomiser built for Katana Zero v1.0.5 by madinsane, it replaces all the enemies and throwables (configurable) with random other objects of the same type. It uses UndertaleModLib (https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool) to read and edit the game data.

This is an early version and is rather simple currently, it doesn't place enemies that have special events (such as dialogue) or enemies that are spawned after the start of the room.

1. Select your backup of data.win as the input file in the KatanaZeroRando.exe
